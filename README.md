# Unofficial F# course at MFF

A few people expressed interest in learning some F#, so we will meet occasionally throughout the winter semester for a series of hands-on sessions on F#.

**When:** Tuesday 10:40, most likely every other week  
**Where:** Corridor in front of S204 (2nd floor left)

This will be hands-on, so bring your own computer with F#! Make sure you have an F# editor and can run F# using F# interactive. We'll start with the REPL and a the typical way of using F# relies on an editor that can give you inline tool tips with type information and highlight type errors on the fly - so it would be great if you can have a setup that supports this. There are multiple tools and configurations, but Ionide (https://ionide.io) is a good starting point. You can find other options on the F# foundation web page (https://fsharp.org).
